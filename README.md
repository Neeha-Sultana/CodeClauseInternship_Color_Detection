# Color_Detection_CodeClause
This project is a Python program that allows users to detect and identify the color of a pixel in an image by double-clicking on it. It displays the color's name and its corresponding RGB values using OpenCV and a CSV color dataset.


This Python project employs OpenCV and Pandas libraries to create an interactive color detection tool. Users provide an image as input, and upon double-clicking any pixel in the image, the program identifies the closest matching color from a predefined CSV dataset. It then displays this color's name and RGB values at the top of the image, along with a filled rectangle in the selected color. The program continuously runs until the user presses the 'Esc' key, making it a user-friendly tool for inspecting and identifying colors in images.
